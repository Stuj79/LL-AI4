Since I can't create an actual image file, this text file represents where the logo would be placed.
A proper implementation would include an actual logo image file here.

For the Streamlit app, you can use:
1. A placeholder image as configured in the code
2. Replace it with a real logo later
3. Or modify the code to not require a logo
