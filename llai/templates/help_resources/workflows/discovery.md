# Discovery Phase Guide

## Overview
The Discovery phase is the first step in the Legal AI Marketing Assistant workflow. During this phase, you'll gather foundational information about your legal practice, existing marketing platforms, and analytics to inform later analysis.

## Key Components

### Stakeholder Identification
- **Purpose**: Identify key stakeholders who influence marketing decisions
- **Process**: Answer guided questions about your practice's structure
- **Outcome**: A stakeholder map showing roles, influence, and information needs

### Platform Inventory
- **Purpose**: Document all existing marketing channels and platforms
- **Process**: List websites, social media, directories, and other platforms
- **Outcome**: Comprehensive inventory of digital presence with metadata

### Analytics Collection
- **Purpose**: Gather performance metrics for existing marketing assets
- **Process**: Upload analytics exports or manually enter key performance data
- **Outcome**: Baseline performance metrics for comparative analysis

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all marketing channels, even those with minimal activity
2. **Involve Multiple Team Members**: Different perspectives improve discovery quality
3. **Prepare Analytics Access**: Have Google Analytics, social media insights, etc. ready
4. **Consider Regional Variations**: Note any province-specific marketing considerations
5. **Document Goals**: Record specific goals for each channel to measure against later

## Common Questions

**Q: How detailed should our stakeholder information be?**
A: Include anyone who influences marketing decisions or consumes marketing reports. Note their specific information needs and preferences.

**Q: We have multiple websites. How should we handle this?**
A: Enter each website separately in the platform inventory, noting the relationship between them (main site, microsites, etc.).

**Q: What if we don't have access to all our analytics?**
A: Enter what you have access to. Estimates are better than nothing, but mark them as estimates.

## Next Steps
After completing the Discovery phase, you'll move to the Content Inventory phase where you'll catalog and categorize all your marketing content across platforms.
