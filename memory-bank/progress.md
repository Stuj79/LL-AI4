# Progress

This document tracks what currently works, what remains to be built, the overall status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## 1. What Works (Current Functionality)
*   **Week 1 Deliverables Completed:**
    *   Atomic Agents development environment set up in conda environment `llai-atomic`
    *   Comprehensive framework comparison study documented in `memory-bank/supporting-documents/framework_comparison_study.md`
    *   Hello world examples created for both Legion (`examples/legion_hello_world.py`) and Atomic Agents (`examples/atomic_agents_hello_world.py`)
    *   Task planning and tracking system established using software-planning MCP
*   **Week 2 Deliverables Completed:**
    *   Core data models migrated to BaseIOSchema in `llai/models/*_atomic.py` files
    *   Bridge interfaces created in `llai/bridge/model_adapters.py` for seamless transition
    *   Centralized configuration system implemented in `llai/config/settings.py`
    *   Comprehensive test suite created in `llai/tests/test_atomic_models.py`

## 2. What's Left to Build (Roadmap/Backlog)
*   **Current Phase (Phase 1: Foundation and Understanding - Weeks 1-4):**
    *   **Week 1: Environment Setup and Framework Analysis**
        *   [x] Set Up Atomic Agents Development Environment
        *   [x] Conduct Framework Comparison Study
    *   **Week 2: Data Model Stabilization**
        *   [x] Migrate Core Data Models (Pydantic to BaseIOSchema)
        *   [x] Create Bridge Interfaces
        *   [x] Standardize Configuration Models
    *   **Week 3: Error Handling and Utilities Migration**
        *   [ ] Implement Atomic-Agents Error Patterns
        *   [ ] Migrate JSON Utilities
        *   [ ] Update Logging Infrastructure
    *   **Week 4: Testing Infrastructure Setup**
        *   [ ] Create Testing Patterns for Atomic-Agents
        *   [ ] Implement Mock Providers
        *   [ ] Establish Baseline Performance Tests
*   **Future Phases (as per `migration-playbook.md`):**
    *   Phase 2: Agent Migration (Weeks 5-8)
    *   Phase 3: Tool Standardization (Weeks 9-12)
    *   Phase 4: UI Modernization (Weeks 13-16)
    *   Phase 5: Testing, Documentation, and Optimization (Weeks 17-20)

## 3. Current Overall Status
Phase 1, Week 2 completed successfully. Ready to proceed to Week 3: Error Handling and Utilities Migration.

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs
*   None reported at project start.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Rationale
*   **{{CURRENT_DATE_YYYY_MM_DD}}:** Project formally initiated.
    *   **Previous State/Approach:** Pre-project planning.
    *   **New State/Approach:** Commencing Phase 1 of migration as per `migration-playbook.md`.
    *   **Rationale for Change:** Official start of the refactoring project.
