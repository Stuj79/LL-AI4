## 3. Current Overall Status
Phase 2, Week 5: Core Agent Abstraction - IN PROGRESS. Implementing LegalMarketingBaseAgent and establishing patterns for agent migration.

## 4. Known Issues & Bugs
*   None reported at project completion of Phase 1.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Rationale
*   **2025-05-25:** Project formally initiated.
    *   **Previous State/Approach:** Pre-project planning.
    *   **New State/Approach:** Commencing Phase 1 of migration as per `migration-playbook.md`.
    *   **Rationale for Change:** Official start of the refactoring project.
*   **2025-05-25:** Phase 1 Foundation completed.
    *   **Previous State/Approach:** Planning and setup phase.
    *   **New State/Approach:** Comprehensive testing infrastructure, utilities, and patterns established.
    *   **Rationale for Change:** Solid foundation enables confident agent migration in Phase 2.
*   **2025-05-26:** Phase 2 initiated with legal marketing domain research and architecture planning.
    *   **Previous State/Approach:** Generic agent migration approach.
    *   **New State/Approach:** Legal marketing-specific base agent with compliance features, disclaimer management, and ethical considerations.
    *   **Rationale for Change:** Legal marketing domain requires specialized compliance, accuracy, and ethical safeguards that must be built into the foundation.
