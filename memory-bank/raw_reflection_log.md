TaskRef: "Week 5 Planning: Legal Marketing Base Agent Architecture and StakeholderIdentificationAgent Migration Strategy"

Learnings:
- Legal marketing AI requires specialized compliance features including automatic disclaimer injection, advertising rule validation, and confidentiality protection
- Accuracy safeguards are critical - all AI-generated legal content requires human review before publication per industry standards
- Bias mitigation essential to avoid discriminatory targeting based on protected characteristics (race, religion) per ABA Model Rule 7.1
- Audit trails and transparency requirements are more stringent than general marketing AI applications
- Context provider pattern enables clean separation of domain knowledge from agent logic while maintaining testability
- Agent factory pattern essential for managing complex agent configurations and LLM client dependencies
- Starting with simpler, self-contained agents (StakeholderIdentificationAgent) enables pattern validation before tackling complex agents

Difficulties:
- Balancing legal compliance requirements with performance and usability constraints
- Determining appropriate level of human-in-the-loop validation for different agent types
- Structuring disclaimer and compliance checking without impacting response times

Successes:
- Comprehensive research using Perplexity MCP provided detailed legal marketing AI requirements and compliance considerations
- Established clear agent migration order prioritizing pattern establishment over complexity
- Designed LegalMarketingBaseAgent architecture with disclaimer management, compliance checking, and confidentiality handling
- Planned context providers (DisclaimerProvider, AdvertisingRuleProvider, EthicalGuidelineProvider) for domain-specific context injection

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Legal marketing AI domain requirements and compliance patterns
- Agent architecture design patterns for domain-specific base classes
- Migration strategy insights for complex framework transitions
- Context provider patterns for domain knowledge injection
