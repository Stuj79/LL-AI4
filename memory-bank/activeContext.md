*   [ ] Implement content analysis agents with Atomic Agents patterns
*   [ ] Create gap analysis agents using established utilities and testing patterns
*   [ ] Validate functional parity between Legion and Atomic Agents implementations

**Medium-term (Phase 2 Completion):**
*   [ ] Complete all agent migrations with comprehensive test coverage
*   [ ] Establish performance comparison metrics against Legion baselines
*   [ ] Document agent migration patterns for team adoption
*   [ ] Prepare for Phase 3 tool standardization

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions

**Agent Migration Strategy:**
*   Which agent should be migrated first to establish patterns and validate the approach?
*   How to structure agent inheritance hierarchy for legal marketing domain?
*   What context providers are needed for legal compliance and taxonomy integration?

**Testing Implementation:**
*   How to integrate the new testing infrastructure with existing CI/CD processes?
*   What additional mock scenarios are needed for comprehensive agent testing?
*   How to balance test execution time with comprehensive coverage?

**Performance Validation:**
*   How to establish meaningful performance comparisons during migration?
*   What metrics should trigger performance regression alerts?
*   How to validate that Atomic Agents implementation meets performance targets?

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Recently Emerged or Reinforced)

**Testing Excellence:**
*   All components must have comprehensive test coverage using established patterns
*   Mock LLM providers should be used for deterministic testing of agent logic
*   Performance baselines must be established before migration and monitored throughout
*   Property-based testing should validate consistent behavior across input variations

**Structured Error Handling:**
*   All errors should use BaseIOSchema for consistent, serializable reporting
*   Error context should include operation, component, and timestamp information
*   User-friendly messages should be separate from technical error details

**Configuration-Driven Infrastructure:**
*   All infrastructure components (logging, error handling, testing) should be configurable
*   Environment-specific settings should override defaults gracefully
*   Configuration validation should happen at application startup

**Documentation Excellence:**
*   All BaseIOSchema models require comprehensive field descriptions
*   Testing patterns should be documented with clear examples
*   Architectural decisions should be documented with rationale
*   Code should be self-documenting with clear naming and structure

## 6. Learnings & Insights (Current Session)

**Testing Infrastructure Development:**
*   Comprehensive testing strategy significantly improves confidence in migration process
*   Mock LLM providers with pattern matching enable sophisticated test scenarios
*   Performance profiling infrastructure provides objective migration validation
*   Pytest fixtures and configuration streamline test development and maintenance

**Non-Deterministic System Testing:**
*   Property-based testing effectively validates consistent behavior across input variations
*   Output characteristic validation more reliable than exact content matching
*   Mock providers essential for deterministic testing of agent logic and error handling
*   Integration tests crucial for validating complete workflows and component interactions

**Performance Baseline Establishment:**
*   Structured performance measurement enables objective comparison during migration
*   Resource profiling (CPU, memory, execution time) provides comprehensive performance picture
*   Baseline data persistence enables trend analysis and regression detection
*   Performance thresholds should be established based on business requirements

**Migration Preparation Excellence:**
*   Comprehensive testing infrastructure accelerates subsequent migration phases
*   Well-documented patterns enable consistent implementation across team members
