# Active Context

This document tracks the current state of work, recent decisions, and immediate next steps. It's a dynamic snapshot of the project's momentum.

## 1. Current Focus
Phase 2, Week 6: Discovery Phase Agent Migration - `run_stakeholder_agent.py` example script is now fully functional after resolving client initialization errors. Ready for remaining Week 6 tasks (Migrate Platform Inventory Logic).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

**Fix `run_stakeholder_agent.py` Execution (2025-05-27):**
*   **Resolved `ValidationError`:** Modified `llai/bridge/llm_client_manager.py` to ensure `_create_openai_client` and `_create_anthropic_client` methods return actual `instructor.Instructor` client instances, not custom wrappers. This fixed the Pydantic validation error for the `client` field in `StakeholderIdentificationAgentConfig`.
*   **Corrected Mock Client:** Updated `MockLLMClientManager` in `llai/bridge/llm_client_manager.py` to also return a mock `Instructor`-compatible client for consistency in testing.
*   **Script Update:** Adjusted `examples/run_stakeholder_agent.py` to correctly obtain the LLM client from the factory's client manager and pass it during `StakeholderIdentificationAgentConfig` instantiation. Also fixed a minor `AttributeError` when printing the LLM client type.
*   **Outcome:** The `examples/run_stakeholder_agent.py` script now executes successfully, demonstrating correct agent instantiation and LLM client integration.

**Week 6 Task 1 Completion (2025-05-27):**
*   **Real LLM Client Manager:** Created comprehensive LLM client manager in `llai/bridge/llm_client_manager.py` with provider abstraction supporting OpenAI and Anthropic

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Recently Emerged or Reinforced)

**Real LLM Integration Excellence:**
*   LLM client managers should provide provider abstraction with automatic model-to-provider mapping
*   Error handling must include graceful fallback to mock responses for system resilience
*   Configuration-driven LLM provider selection enables environment-specific deployments
*   Agent code should remain provider-agnostic through proper abstraction layers

**Testing Excellence:**
*   All components must have comprehensive test coverage using established patterns
*   Mock LLM providers should be used for deterministic testing of agent logic
*   Performance baselines must be established before migration and monitored throughout
*   Property-based testing should validate consistent behavior across input variations

**Structured Error Handling:**
*   All errors should use BaseIOSchema for consistent, serializable reporting
*   Error context should include operation, component, and timestamp information
*   User-friendly messages should be separate from technical error details

**Configuration-Driven Infrastructure:**
*   All infrastructure components (logging, error handling, testing) should be configurable
*   Environment-specific settings should override defaults gracefully
*   Configuration validation should happen at application startup

**Documentation Excellence:**
*   All BaseIOSchema models require comprehensive field descriptions
*   Testing patterns should be documented with clear examples
*   Architectural decisions should be documented with rationale
*   Code should be self-documenting with clear naming and structure

## 6. Learnings & Insights (Current Session)

**LLM Client Initialization & Pydantic Validation:**
*   Pydantic models (like agent configurations) are validated at the moment of their instantiation. If a field (e.g., `client`) has specific type requirements (e.g., must be an `Instructor` instance), that requirement must be met *during* `__init__`, not later by a factory or other mechanism.
*   LLM client managers must return the precise client type expected by the consuming framework (e.g., `instructor.Instructor` for Atomic Agents `BaseAgentConfig`), not just a wrapper with a similar interface, to pass Pydantic validation.
*   When debugging `ValidationError` for client types, verify the actual type being passed versus the type hint in the Pydantic model.

**Debugging Agent Instantiation:**
*   A multi-step debugging process was effective:
    1.  Initial fix attempt: Pass client from factory to config in the example script. (Still failed due to wrapper type).
    2.  Deeper fix: Modify `LLMClientManager` to return correct `Instructor` instances.
    3.  Consistency fix: Update `MockLLMClientManager` to also provide `Instructor`-like mocks.
    4.  Final script adjustment: Ensure the example script correctly uses the now-valid client from the manager.

**Real LLM Integration Patterns:**
