# Active Context

This document tracks the current state of work, recent decisions, and immediate next steps. It's a dynamic snapshot of the project's momentum.

## 1. Current Focus
Planning for Phase 1, Week 2: Data Model Stabilization (as per `memory-bank/supporting-documents/migration-playbook.md`).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
*   Memory Bank initialized.
*   Project refactoring (Legion to Atomic Agents) is formally commencing.

## 3. Next Steps
*   [ ] Plan the implementation of Phase 1 - Week 2 tasks:
    *   [ ] Migrate Core Data Models (Pydantic to BaseIOSchema)
    *   [ ] Create Bridge Interfaces
    *   [ ] Standardize Configuration Models

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions
*   How to best structure the plan for Week 1 tasks, incorporating relevant MCP tools to enhance the "Framework Comparison Study" and task management.
*   Prioritization of specific MCP tools for Week 1:
    *   **Documentation/Info Gathering:** `atomic-agent-docs`, `legion-docs` (primary); `context7`, `perplexity`, `brave-search` (supplementary).
    *   **Codebase/Framework Structure Analysis:** `filesystem` (for Legion structure).
    *   **Structuring Comparison Findings:** `memory` MCP (for knowledge graph), `repo-documenter` (for Mermaid diagrams if used).
    *   **Guiding Study Process:** `mcp-sequentialthinking-tools`.
    *   **Task Planning:** `software-planning` MCP.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Recently Emerged or Reinforced)
*   Adherence to the `migration-playbook.md` for phased execution.
*   Emphasis on understanding framework differences before coding (as per Week 1 Learning Focus).

## 6. Learnings & Insights (Current Session)
*   Memory Bank structure and initialization process clarified.
*   Project kickoff confirmed.
*   Detailed analysis of available MCP servers (`atomic-agent-docs`, `legion-docs`, `filesystem`, `memory`, `perplexity`, `context7`, `repo-documenter`, `software-planning`, `brave-search`, `mcp-sequentialthinking-tools`) identified significant potential for enhancing Week 1 tasks, particularly the "Framework Comparison Study".
*   The `filesystem` MCP is confirmed to be scoped to the current project directory.
*   The new `atomic-agent-docs` MCP is a key resource for understanding the target framework.
*   **Framework Comparison Study completed**: Comprehensive analysis documented in `memory-bank/supporting-documents/framework_comparison_study.md` comparing Legion and Atomic Agents frameworks across architecture, tool integration, memory management, schema validation, error handling, and configuration.
*   **Environment Setup Completed**: Conda environment `llai-atomic` created and `atomic-agents` framework installed.
