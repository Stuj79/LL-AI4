## Framework Migration Strategies

**Pattern: Strangler Fig Migration with Bridge Adapters**
- For large-scale framework migrations, implement bridge adapters that enable gradual component replacement without system downtime
- Create compatibility layers that translate between old and new data formats during transition periods
- Maintain functional parity throughout migration to enable rollback at any stage
- *Rationale:* Reduces risk, enables continuous delivery, and allows parallel development of legacy and new features

**Pattern: Environment Isolation for Framework Experimentation**
- Use conda environments to isolate new framework dependencies from existing systems
- Create hello world examples for both old and new frameworks to validate setup and understand differences
- Document environment setup procedures for team consistency
- *Rationale:* Prevents dependency conflicts and enables safe experimentation with new technologies

## Data Modeling with BaseIOSchema

**Pattern: Enhanced Pydantic Models with Documentation Requirements**
- BaseIOSchema requires explicit field descriptions, improving code documentation quality automatically
- Inheritance patterns work well for creating specialized models from base schemas
- Bridge adapters handle dynamic fields effectively with flexible mapping approaches
- *Rationale:* Better validation, improved documentation, and enhanced debugging capabilities compared to standard Pydantic

**Pattern: Hierarchical Configuration Management**
- Replace scattered environment variables and decorator parameters with centralized BaseIOSchema configuration classes
- Use inheritance to create specialized configurations (e.g., LLMProviderConfig, DatabaseConfig, LoggingConfig)
- Implement environment-specific overrides with clear precedence hierarchy
- *Rationale:* Single source of truth, type-safe configuration, better debugging and troubleshooting

## Structured Error Handling

**Pattern: BaseIOSchema Error Schemas for Consistent Reporting**
- Create error schemas that include error_type, message, context, timestamp, and user_message fields
- Use specialized error schemas for different error categories (LLM, Tool, Configuration, Validation, JSON, API)
- Implement error context objects that capture operation, component, and additional contextual information
- *Rationale:* Consistent error format, better debugging with structured context, serializable errors for logging and monitoring

**Pattern: Multi-Level Error Handling Strategy**
- Provide both exception-raising and safe (error-dict returning) versions of critical functions
- Separate technical error details from user-friendly messages
- Include error recovery suggestions and severity levels in error schemas
- *Rationale:* Flexibility for different use cases, better user experience, enhanced debugging capabilities

## JSON Processing & LLM Response Handling

**Pattern: Multi-Strategy JSON Parsing**
- Implement layered parsing approach: direct JSON parsing → extraction from mixed text → structured error response
- Use BaseIOSchema validation at parse time to catch data integrity issues early
- Provide both strict (exception-raising) and safe (error-returning) parsing functions
- *Rationale:* Handles diverse LLM response formats robustly, catches validation errors early, provides flexibility for different use cases

**Pattern: Schema-First LLM Response Processing**
- Define expected response schemas using BaseIOSchema before implementing LLM interactions
- Use instructor integration for robust LLM response parsing and validation
- Implement fallback strategies for malformed or unexpected responses
- *Rationale:* Better data integrity, clearer API contracts, more reliable LLM integrations

## Configuration-Driven Infrastructure

**Pattern: Centralized Configuration with Environment Overrides**
- Create hierarchical configuration systems using BaseIOSchema models
- Support environment-specific configuration files with clear override precedence
- Validate all configuration at application startup with meaningful error messages
- *Rationale:* Better control over application behavior, easier debugging, environment-specific customization

**Pattern: Rich Logging Integration**
- Use Rich library for enhanced console output with syntax highlighting and structured display
- Implement configuration-driven logging setup with multiple handlers (console, file, rotating)
- Include structured context information in log messages for better debugging
- *Rationale:* Dramatically improved developer experience, better debugging capabilities, professional logging output

## Testing Strategies for AI Applications

**Pattern: Comprehensive Utility Testing**
- Test both success and error scenarios for all utility functions
- Use mock objects for complex dependencies and external services
- Include edge cases and validation error scenarios in test coverage
- *Rationale:* Ensures robust utility functions, validates error handling, provides confidence for refactoring

**Pattern: BaseIOSchema Validation Testing**
- Test schema validation with both valid and invalid data
- Verify error messages and validation behavior
- Test serialization and deserialization round-trips
- *Rationale:* Ensures data models work correctly, validates error handling, confirms API contracts

## MCP Tool Integration Patterns

**Pattern: Multi-Tool Documentation Gathering**
- Use specialized MCP tools (atomic-agent-docs, legion-docs) for framework-specific information
- Leverage general-purpose tools (perplexity, brave-search) for supplementary research
- Combine filesystem analysis with documentation tools for comprehensive understanding
- *Rationale:* More thorough analysis, multiple information sources, better decision-making foundation

**Pattern: Task Planning and Tracking Integration**
- Use software-planning MCP for structured task management and progress tracking
- Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks with complexity scoring
- Track completion status and maintain task context across sessions
- *Rationale:* Better project organization, progress visibility, context preservation

## Architecture Evolution Best Practices

**Pattern: Phase-Based Migration Planning**
- Structure migrations in clear phases with specific deliverables and success criteria
- Complete foundational work (data models, utilities, configuration) before migrating core business logic
- Establish testing and monitoring infrastructure early in the migration process
- *Rationale:* Reduces risk, enables incremental progress validation, provides clear milestones

**Pattern: Documentation-Driven Development**
- Maintain comprehensive architectural documentation throughout migration
- Document technical decisions with rationale for future reference
- Use structured documentation systems (Memory Bank) for context preservation
- *Rationale:* Better decision-making, improved onboarding, knowledge preservation across team changes
