- Use specialized error schemas for different error categories (LLM, Tool, Configuration, Validation, JSON, API)
- Implement error context objects that capture operation, component, and additional contextual information
- *Rationale:* Consistent error format, better debugging with structured context, serializable errors for logging and monitoring

**Pattern: Multi-Level Error Handling Strategy**

- Separate technical error details from user-friendly messages
- Include error recovery suggestions and severity levels in error schemas
- *Rationale:* Flexibility for different use cases, better user experience, enhanced debugging capabilities

## JSON Processing & LLM Response Handling

**Pattern: Multi-Strategy JSON Parsing**
- Implement layered parsing approach: direct JSON parsing → extraction from mixed text → structured error response
- Use BaseIOSchema validation at parse time to catch data integrity issues early
- Provide both strict (exception-raising) and safe (error-returning) parsing functions
- *Rationale:* Handles diverse LLM response formats robustly, catches validation errors early, provides flexibility for different use cases

**Pattern: Schema-First LLM Response Processing**

## Architecture Evolution Best Practices

**Pattern: Phase-Based Migration Planning**
- Structure migrations in clear phases with specific deliverables and success criteria
- Complete foundational work (data models, utilities, configuration) before migrating core business logic
- Establish testing and monitoring infrastructure early in the migration process
- *Rationale:* Reduces risk, enables incremental progress validation, provides clear milestones

**Pattern: Documentation-Driven Development**
- Maintain comprehensive architectural documentation throughout migration
- Document technical decisions with rationale for future reference

## Legal Marketing AI Domain Patterns

**Pattern: Legal Marketing Base Agent Architecture**
- Extend Atomic Agents BaseAgent with domain-specific compliance features including disclaimer management, compliance checking, and confidentiality handling
- Implement structured audit logging for legal compliance requirements with configurable detail levels
- Provide post-processing pipeline that automatically applies legal marketing compliance features
- Include specialized configuration schemas with legal-specific fields (jurisdiction, compliance thresholds, audit levels)
- *Rationale:* Legal marketing AI requires specialized compliance features that must be built into the foundation level to ensure consistent application across all agents

**Pattern: Context Provider Architecture for Domain Knowledge**
- Create abstract provider interfaces (DisclaimerProvider, AdvertisingRuleProvider, EthicalGuidelineProvider) for domain-specific knowledge injection
- Implement both file-based and mock providers to support production and testing scenarios
- Include caching mechanisms and error handling for performance and reliability
- Enable clean separation of domain knowledge from agent logic for better maintainability
- *Rationale:* Separates domain expertise from agent implementation, enables flexible knowledge sources, improves testability and maintainability

- *Rationale:* Enables reliable testing of legal marketing features, reduces external dependencies, allows comprehensive error scenario testing

## LLM Integration & Pydantic Validation Patterns

**Pattern: Exact Client Type for Pydantic Validation at Instantiation**
- Pydantic models (e.g., agent configurations) perform type validation for their fields at the moment of object instantiation (`__init__`).
- If a field is type-hinted to require a specific class instance (e.g., `instructor.Instructor` for an LLM client), the object provided during instantiation must be of that exact type or a compatible subtype. Custom wrappers, even with identical interfaces, may fail this validation if they are not part of the expected type hierarchy.
- *Rationale:* This ensures strict type safety from the outset, preventing runtime errors that could occur if type compatibility was only interface-deep. It helps catch integration issues early in the development lifecycle.

**Pattern: Debugging Pydantic Type ValidationErrors Systematically**
- When encountering a Pydantic `ValidationError` that indicates a type mismatch for an object field (e.g., "Input should be an instance of X, got Y"), focus on the `input_type` (Y) reported in the error message.
- In debugging, explicitly check `type(input_value)` of the object being passed to confirm its actual class, comparing it against the Pydantic model's type hint for that field.
- *Rationale:* This provides a direct way to identify the source of the type mismatch, which is crucial when dealing with complex object creation, factories, or dependency injection where the actual type might not be immediately obvious.

**Pattern: High-Fidelity Mock Clients in Type-Strict Environments**
- In systems employing strict type validation (like Pydantic-based configurations), mock objects (e.g., for LLM clients, database connections) should not only replicate the interface but also, where feasible, the type hierarchy of their real counterparts.
- For instance, if a production component expects an `instructor.Instructor` client, the corresponding mock client used in tests should ideally be an instance of a class that is either `Instructor` or a recognized subtype, or at least pass `isinstance()` checks if the validation relies on them.
- *Rationale:* This allows test environments to more accurately simulate production conditions, including Pydantic's type validation. It helps catch type-related integration issues during testing that might otherwise only appear in production.
