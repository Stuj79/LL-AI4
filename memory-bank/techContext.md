# Tech Context

This document outlines the technologies, development environment, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns for the project.

## 1. Core Technologies
*(List the primary programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and platforms used.)*
*   **Language(s):** [e.g., Python, JavaScript]
*   **Framework(s):** [e.g., Django, React, Node.js]
*   **Database(s):** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
*   **Key Libraries:** [e.g., Pandas, Redux]
*   **Platform(s):** [e.g., AWS, Docker]

## 2. Development Environment Setup
*(Describe how to set up the development environment. Include versions of key tools if important.)*
*   **Prerequisites:** [e.g., Node.js v18+, Python 3.10+]
*   **Setup Steps:**
    1.  [Step 1]
    2.  [Step 2]
*   **Key Commands:**
    *   `npm install` / `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    *   `npm run dev` / `python manage.py runserver`

## 3. Technical Constraints
*(List any technical limitations or constraints that impact development, e.g., performance targets, browser compatibility, security requirements.)*

## 4. Key Dependencies & Services
*(List critical external dependencies or services the project relies on, including versions if specific.)*
*   [Dependency/Service]: [Version/Endpoint] - *Purpose*

## 5. Tool Usage Patterns
*(Describe common tools and how they are used in the development workflow.)*
*   **Version Control:** [e.g., Git, GitHub Flow]
*   **CI/CD:** [e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions] - *Brief description of pipeline*
*   **Linters/Formatters:** [e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Black] - *Key configuration notes*
*   **Testing Tools:** [e.g., Jest, Pytest] - *How to run tests*

## 6. Environment Variables
*(List important environment variables required for the application to run, with placeholder values or descriptions of what they are for. Do NOT commit actual secrets.)*
*   `API_KEY`: (For accessing [Service Name])
*   `DATABASE_URL`: (Connection string for the database)
