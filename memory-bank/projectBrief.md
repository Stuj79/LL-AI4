## Project Overview  
The initiative will **refactor the existing LL-AI Python codebase**—currently bound to a custom “legion” framework—and **migrate it to the atomic-agents AI Assistant Agentic Framework**. This transition modernises the architecture with provider-agnostic interfaces, async-first patterns, and strong type-safety, unlocking easier maintenance, faster feature delivery, and multi-LLM flexibility.

## Objectives & Goals  
| Category | Target Outcome | Success Indicator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Code Quality** | Reduce cyclomatic complexity & remove duplicated patterns | ≥ 40 % drop in >20-score hotspots; unified abstractions |
| **Testing** | Establish comprehensive, reliable test suite | ≥ 85 % unit coverage; ≥ 70 % integration coverage |
| **Architecture** | Achieve provider-agnostic, modular design | Seamless switch among ≥ 3 LLM back-ends; clear separation of agents/tools/memory |
| **Dev Ops** | CI/CD, observability, security best-practice adoption | Automated pipelines, structured logging, secrets management, SLO-based alerts |
| **Performance** | Improve user-perceived latency & resource footprint | 50 % faster average response; ≤ 20 % memory reduction |
| **Delivery** | Execute phased “Strangler Fig” migration roadmap | Milestone completion per 20-week playbook |

## Scope & Deliverables  
### In-Scope  
1. **Framework Migration**  
   * Translate agents, tools, memory, and schemas to atomic-agents base classes.  
2. **Quality Remediation**  
   * Address critical technical debt—framework lock-in, async-sync inconsistency, state-management complexity.  
3. **CI/CD & DevSecOps**  
   * Implement linting, typing, unit + integration tests, vulnerability scans, blue-green deployments, and rollback playbooks.  
4. **Observability**  
   * Structured logging, metrics, tracing, and health-checks across legacy and migrated paths.  
5. **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer**  
   * Developer guides, user help, migration run-book.  
6. **Performance & Regression Testing**  
   * Baseline capture and continuous monitoring of latency, throughput, and memory.  

### Out-of-Scope (Phase-2+)  
* Major UI redesigns beyond incremental Streamlit enhancements.  
* Net-new product features not required for functional parity.

Supporting documents are located in the "memory-bank/supporting-documents" directory.

| Doc # | Title | Purpose | How It Drives This Brief |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Architecture Overview** | Compares current “legion” stack with target atomic-agents design; supplies reference diagrams and key design principles. | Defines architectural north-star and informs refactor scope.  |
| 2 | **Code Quality & Risk Report** | Details complexity hotspots (e.g., `streamlit_app.py` 28), duplication patterns, security gaps, and < 32 % test coverage. | Prioritises technical-debt items and quality objectives.  |
| 3 | **Migration Playbook** | 20-week phased roadmap (Foundation → Agents → Tools → UI → Test & Optimise) with tasks, FTE allocation, risks, and success criteria. | Serves as execution plan and milestone tracker.  |
| 4 | **Best-Practice Checklist** | Prescribes coding standards, testing philosophy for non-deterministic LLMs, observability, security, and deployment guidelines. | Establishes acceptance criteria and CI/CD gates for refactored code. |
