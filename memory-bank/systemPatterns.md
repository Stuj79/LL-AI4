# System Patterns

This document describes the overall architecture of the system, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and critical component relationships.

## 1. System Architecture Overview
*(Provide a high-level description of the system's architecture. A diagram (e.g., Mermaid) can be very helpful here.)*

### 1.1. Key Components & Responsibilities
*(List major components and their primary roles.)*
*   **Component A:** [Responsibility]
*   **Component B:** [Responsibility]

### 1.2. Data Flow
*(Describe how data moves through the system.)*

## 2. Key Technical Decisions & Rationale
*(Document significant technical choices and why they were made.)*
*   **Decision:** [e.g., Choice of database, framework, architectural style]
    *   **Rationale:** [Reasons for the decision, alternatives considered]

## 3. Design Patterns in Use
*(List key design patterns employed in the project and where they are used.)*
*   **Pattern:** [e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer]
    *   **Context/Usage:** [Where and why this pattern is used]

## 4. Critical Implementation Paths
*(Identify and describe any particularly complex or critical pathways or workflows in the system.)*

## 5. Integration Points
*(Describe how this system interacts with other systems or services.)*
